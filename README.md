#  learning-nodejs

Welcome to my **Learning Node.js** repository!  This project serves as a hands-on journey into backend development using **Node.js** and JavaScript. Dive in to explore how I build, experiment, and understand real-world concepts through mini-projects, examples, and documentation.

---

##  What's Inside

- **Foundational Concepts**  
  Deep dive into the basics of Node.js—understanding how servers work, setting up environments, handling file operations, and working with modules.

- **Mini-Projects & Practice Files**  
  Real-world exercises like CRUD applications, middleware creation, file uploads, simple REST APIs, and more. These are structured into logical files like `crud.js`, `middleware2.js`, and such.

- **Templating with EJS**  
  Learn how to render dynamic server-side UI with EJS templating, bridging frontend and backend for a smoother learning curve.

- **Routing & Middleware**  
  Explore Express.js structures with layered routing (`express.js`, `mainServer.js`) and middleware logic (`middlewares.js`) to manage requests effectively.

- **Database Integrations**  
  Track my work with data storage logic—whether it's CRUD operations via plain files or MongoDB (via `database.js`)—laying the foundation for full-stack apps.

- **Supplementary Resources**  
  - `app.js`, `server.js` — key setup and server files  
  - `challengesPractice.js`, `data.js` — personal practice sessions and exercises  
  - Frontend experiment files like `index.html`, `style.css` for connecting backend learning with UI interaction

##  Tech Stack & Workflow

- **Node.js & Express.js** for server environments and RESTful routing  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**, **EJS**, **HTML**, **CSS** for both backend logic and templating  
- **File System (fs)** and MongoDB logic for data persistence  
- Clean and modular structure for easy understanding and growth

##  How to Get Started

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AbdulMoeez1278/learning-nodejs.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**
    ```bash
    cd learning-nodejs
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(if this repo starts using packages like Express or EJS)*

4. **Run a sample file**
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```
    Or whichever `.js` you want to explore—this gives instant output and helps track your progress.

##  Goals & Roadmap

This repo is more than just code—it’s my learning log. Here's where I'm headed next:

- Build a robust **REST API** using Express.js and MongoDB
- Develop authentication flows with **JWT** and **bcrypt**
- Create full-stack applications with **React.js** (forming the MERN stack!)
- Implement deployment pipelines (Netlify, Render, Heroku, CI/CD)
- Master backend testing with **Jest** or **Mocha**
